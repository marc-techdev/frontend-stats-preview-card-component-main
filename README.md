## What I Learned

- Using CSS variables with `:root` and `var()` for consistent colors and typography
- Building mobile-first, then enhancing desktop with a `@media (min-width: 1024px)` query
- Creating the desktop layout by reversing order with Flexbox (`flex-direction: row-reverse`)
- Adding a purple image overlay using `mix-blend-mode: multiply` and `opacity`
